# ft_containers

School project: C++ containers, easy mode

## Testing

Use `make` to compile both `ft_containers` and `std_containers`. These are executable containing tests for my containers and the standard library's ones.

Use `make test` to compare the results.

`make leak_test` will also check leaks using *valgrind*.
